# NourishNet

"NourishNet" is a platform from Bengaluru, India, committed to addressing UN Sustainable Development Goals, particularly focusing on reducing poverty, hunger, and improving health. Our app tackles food wastage by connecting donors and users.

Donors can post surplus food, schedule donation drives, and engage with the community. Users can view active drives, locate nearby donations, and participate in community discussions.

Future plans include offline registration for inclusivity, partnering with food banks for efficient distribution, and mobilizing volunteers to deliver food directly to those in need.

Join us in our mission to combat hunger and promote sustainable development.
